# opticfiber(Prototype)

author @Victor Mour√£o<br/>

A program to control a pic18f4550 and count interrupts of light between two optic fibers.<br/>
This code set an LCD 2x16 to show time counter in miliseconds and stop counting when the light is interrupted 3 times(The counter starts at 0 and ends at 3. So this is going to stops only after 4 interrupts. It needs to be fixed yet).<br/>
The countmr() routine count the time and It is activated when there's an interrupt at TIMER0(TIMER0 is set inside main routine).<br/>
The botao() routine is the interrupt at RB1 pin. In the ISIS design, It is a button that simulate a photodiode recieving the light from the opctic fiber.
The setPin() routine set the pif18f4550 configs.<br/>
The delayM() routine was designed to slow the instructions speed to set the LCD configs at set_LCD() routine.<br/>
The converte(int c) routine converts an integer to ASCII character and the result is used to set LCD characters in these routines:<br/> contaMil_un(), contaMil_dez(), contaMil_cent(), contaMil_mil(), contaSeg_un(), contaSeg_dez(), contaMin_un() and contaMin_dez().<br/>
Those routines are used in the mostraNumero() routine to show on the LCD the time counting in miliseconds.<br/>
The mostravolta() routine shows a message in Portuguese/BR and the Interrupt counter at that moment.<br/>
Finally, the main() routine calls four routines setPin(), set_LCD(), mostravolta() and mostraNumero().<br/>
The two last routines are called inside the while(1) loop.<br/>
